                            mercy ministry is helping people with a practical need in the name 
                            of Jesus Christ ,this can take many forms and can be achieved in 
                            different ways
                            <br>
                            But why do we engage in mercy ministry? For many of us ,
                            we have experienced the challanges of poverty or the physical 
                            pain of an ailment that interrupted our lives and so we want others to
                            experiencejoy too

                                Jesus calls us to care for those in need and to give in His 
                                name because when we do these things we are doing them unto Him
